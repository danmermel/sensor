First you have to get the RPI to control a car with a couple of motors. I explained that here:

The next step is to wire an ultrasound obstacle detector to the arrangement.

I used the HC-SR04

And I followed the instructions here to do it, which I found very good.

The rest is applying a bit of coding to sense distance and turn the car away from obstacles, which is in the sensor.rb script

Again, many thanks to all the people who make this possible, by posting all their helpful instructions and doing awesome stuff all over the internet.
